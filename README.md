# 🩺 Predictive Analytics & Readmission Analysis for Diabetes Management

This project uses machine learning to analyze hospital readmission data for diabetic patients, aiming to uncover patterns and build predictive models that can help healthcare providers reduce unnecessary readmissions and improve patient outcomes.

## 🎯 Objective

- Identify key factors contributing to patient readmission
- Build predictive models to classify readmission risk
- Provide actionable insights for diabetes management

## 📊 Dataset

We use the **Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999–2008** dataset, which contains over 100,000 patient records.

📥 [Download the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)

Features include:
- Demographics (age, gender, race)
- Medical history (diagnoses, medications)
- Hospital encounters (admission type, discharge disposition)
- Readmission status (within 30 days, after 30 days, or no readmission)

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧠 Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- 📊 Performance Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- 🔍 Feature Importance Analysis
- 📉 Readmission Risk Visualization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📥 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sudharshan59/Predictive-Analytics-and-Readmission-Analysis-for-Diabetes-Management.git
cd Predictive-Analytics-and-Readmission-Analysis-for-Diabetes-Management

# Open the notebook
jupyter notebook Predictive Analytics and Readmission Analysis for Diabetes Management.ipynb
📌 Insights
Patients with certain diagnoses and discharge dispositions show higher readmission rates

Medication changes and number of prior visits are strong predictors

Predictive models can help flag high-risk patients for follow-up care
